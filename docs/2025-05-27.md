[x] (Lyne) Working on dataset generation for is-a hypernym relationship between two words 
[x] (Valentin) Refactoring the dataset generation code for faster reading abilities

Lyne has worked on a code for is-a hypernym relationship dataset generation, but she faced some problems with generation time
(more than 1h to generate 1000 lines). After working on refactoring the code, it now works properly.
